# Verbatim -dApp

## What it does
A decentralised Indeed job scraper that returns to users jobs based on their preferred job roles and titles. 

## How it works
The front-end was created using React and interacts with a database that's hosted on MongoDB. Our dApp hosted on Koii then fetches the userData and returns all relevant Indeed jobs. Users that run the this Verbatim webscraping task are rewarded with Koii tokens :).
